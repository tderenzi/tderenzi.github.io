      <p>I was hired as the Senior Design Research Lead for <strong>an initiative funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to explore market opportunities for their Reinvented Toilets (RTs) — novel sanitation systems designed to address global sanitation challenges.</strong></p>
<p>The project was led by Dalberg, a strategy and policy firm contracted by the Sanitation Technology Platform, an organization supporting the development and commercialization of BMGF's new sanitation products. <strong>I collaborated with a cross-functional team, including product designers, UX fellows, data collectors, and local guides, to conduct comprehensive field research across multiple cities.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="is-3 title">The Problem</h3>
      <p>Globally, 2 billion people lack access to basic sanitation <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/goal-06/#:~:text=The%20population%20using%20safely%20managed,million%20people%20practised%20open%20defecation">UNSTAT</a>. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in developing innovative toilet technology but needed to understand adoption pathways. <strong>There was uncertainty about how to introduce this novel technology in low-income markets, making market-specific insights essential to inform both product design and go-to-market strategy.</strong></p>

      <h3 class="is-3 title">What I did</h3>
      <p><strong>Team Alignment</strong>: I led two diverse field teams (10 members in total) across two countries, ensuring alignment and clear communication on project objectives and roles. I developed and implemented detailed research and recruitment plans, coordinating with local fixers and guides to facilitate seamless fieldwork.</p>
<p>Upwards alignment was essential due to the multiple stakeholders involved. Dalberg contracted with the <strong>Sanitation Technology Platform (STeP)</strong> to streamline field testing and commercialization of new sanitation products for the <strong>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)</strong>. Within Dalberg:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dalberg Advisors</strong> led the market-sizing and go-to-market strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Dalberg Research</strong> focused on quantitative research with target user groups.</li>
<li><strong>Dalberg Design</strong>, my department, conducted qualitative research with the same user groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep the project on track, I coordinated closely across Dalberg departments to ensure aligned objectives, improved execution, and integrated data collection efforts. I had weekly check-ins with <strong>STeP</strong> to share progress, discuss challenges, and adjust plans as needed. I also reported milestones to <strong>BMGF</strong>, presenting key deliverables and final insights to support data-driven decisions on product design and market strategy.</p>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Multi-Method Approach</h4>
        I developed a sequential, multi-method approach to reduce cultural bias in sanitation research. We began with contextual interviews to build trust and gain unbiased insights into participants' daily lives. By layering methods—contextual inquiry, card sorting, concept testing, and surveys—we cross-verified responses, uncovering nuanced sanitation needs and ensuring the Reinvented Toilet (RT) design aligned with user expectations.

      <div class="column">
        <h4 class="title is-4">Contextual interviews</h4>
        Conducted 51 two-hour interviews with landlords and tenants, documenting behaviors and attitudes toward utilities. This method mapped their utility needs, spending patterns, and key decision points, also identifying technical requirements (e.g., water for flushing, electricity) essential for RT functionality.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Card sorting</h4>
        Participants ranked sanitation features based on preference, revealing values, unmet needs, and upgrade priorities. Visual cards helped overcome language barriers, and observing non-verbal cues allowed deeper probing into preferences and biases.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Concept testing</h4>
        Since we didn't have a physical prototype due to development confidentiality, we created simple visual representations of the product's key features. We presented participants with a simplified image of the RT and engaged them in an in-depth discussion about the potential by-products that the toilet could produce. Using visual images, participants selected their top three preferred by-products, explaining their rationale. We also explored preferences for installation, maintenance, and payment, assessing alignment with local sanitation needs.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Quantitative Surveys</h4>
        The Dalberg Research team initially conducted a portion of the 600 planned surveys in one country. After I joined, I led my team review and refine the survey for better alignment and triangulation with our qualitative data collection methods. With these adjustments, the team completed the remaining surveys, enabling us to integrate quantitative and qualitative insights for a comprehensive analysis.

      <p>By triangulating qualitative and quantitative data, I uncovered key patterns in user needs, technical requirements and constraints, as well as market opportunities.</p>
<p>I developed <strong>personas</strong> for the target user groups in each market, <strong>capturing the availability, accessibility, and reliability of basic services</strong>. These personas <strong>highlighted critical needs for essential services and preferences for potential by-products</strong> produced by the Reinvented Toilets (RTs).</p>
<p>Using the insights gained from data analysis, I created detailed <strong>summaries of the 12 input and 11 output operating parameters of the RTs</strong>. These parameters <strong>outlined the ideal operating ranges for RT developers to consider when designing or modifying the systems</strong>.</p>

      <h3 class="is-3 title">Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Affordability is Critical</strong>: Households are price-sensitive and prioritize other basic needs (e.g. electricity) over sanitation improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product Value Lies in By-products</strong>: RTs' ability to generate electricity or biogas was highly attractive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skepticism Toward New Products</strong>: Users expressed skepticism toward unproven technologies and wanted physical proof before committing financially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Constraints</strong>: Limited access to basic utilities posed a challenge for RT operation.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making</strong>: Delivered critical user, technical, and environmental requirements to partners, <strong>equipping stakeholders with the data needed to develop effective sanitation systems in targeted markets</strong>.

<li>
<p><strong>Market Opportunity Identification</strong>: Determined that <strong>Nigeria presented a stronger market for Reinvented Toilets (RTs) compared to Kenya</strong>, due to higher demand for reliable basic services like electricity, and a less established sanitation market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Investment Recommendations</strong>: Provided the foundation with <strong>insights to guide $200 million in future grant investments</strong>, recommending projects such as multi-unit toilets and technologies that could produce electricity as a byproduct, aligning future development with market needs.</p>
