      <p>Kaikoo is building an all-in-one desktop tool to help eSports coaches &amp; gamers track performance to take their skills to the next level. They wanted to learn more about their users’ needs, prioritize features and make improvements to the existing platform.</p>
<p>In this project, I empathized with eSports enthusiasts, ensured alignment by facilitating stakeholder workshops, validated a set of features, tested the performance of the prototype we built and developed assets to handover to the client.</p>
<p>I collaborated closely with a product manager, a visual designer and kaikoo’s web developer.</p>

      <p>Kaikoo is launching a platform to help eSports players and coaches who are frustrated with analyzing and tracking gameplay data. These users must utilize multiple software/tools to gain insights into their teams’ performance. This is time-consuming and distracts them from more important activities, like practicing or coaching a team.</p>
<p>Solving this problem will allow our client to grow their user base by becoming a recognized brand within the eSports community. It would also impact coaches and players positively because visualising data will be more efficient and it will help them improve the overall performance of the team.</p>

      <h3 class="is-3 title">What I did</h3>
      <p>The goal was to conduct generative research to gain a deeper understanding about the mental models that eSports users have and evaluative research to validate a set of features proposed by the client.</p>
<p>We began by having a conversation with our client to define the scope of the project, then analyzed the competition to implement best practices and recruited a total of 16 participants for interviews to discover their needs and wants when it comes to life as an eSports enthusiast. We also shadowed 3 users and ran a total of 12 experiments to learn how they use existing tools and be able to validate/invalidate features.</p>
<p>Stakeholder Interviews. Benchmarking. User Interviews. Contextual Inquiries. Usability testing.</p>

      <h3 class="is-3 title">What I asked</h3>
      <p>This project was special, I had zero knowledge about the eSports community and this fueled my curiosity. I created a question board to guide the research process and the conversations I had with users.</p>
<ul>
<li>What challenges must be addressed so that users prefer kaikoo over competitors?</li>
<li>What behaviours and processes are involved in coaching an eSports team?</li>
<li>What’s important to create a great web app experience for eSports enthusiasts?</li>
<li>What gameplay data is important for a coach to visualise at a glance and why?</li>
</ul>
