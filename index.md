As a researcher, my job is to develop and carry out research strategies that leverage technology to solve a wide range of challenges. I start by gathering contextual information about these challenges and then work alongside intended users to experiment with potential solutions. My aim is to identify markets where these solutions can be applied to make a positive impact.

I have a unique background in civil and environmental engineering, international development, and product development. Please refer to my curriculum vitae for a summary of my academic and professional history. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:Taogunyoku@gmail.com">Taogunyoku@gmail.com</a> for further questions or information.
