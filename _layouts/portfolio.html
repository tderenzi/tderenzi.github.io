            <p>Organization: Early Learning Outcome Measurement (ELOM), now part of DataDrive2030
Timeline: 4 months
Role: Lead UX Researcher and Strategist
Overview
ELOM, focused on early childhood development data collection, faced significant challenges with a fragmented data management system. These inefficiencies, along with data inaccuracies and security concerns, were impacting productivity and decision-making. This case study demonstrates how I leveraged user-centered research to design a more streamlined system, ultimately improving organizational efficiency, data quality, and security.
Challenge
The existing system used multiple servers and disparate tools, leading to a convoluted process for form creation, data entry, and storage. The lack of centralization hindered real-time monitoring and complicated data cleaning, causing delays and inaccuracies. There were also concerns around securing personal identifiable data (PII).
Objective: To assess the entire data value chain of the system, identify pain points, and design an integrated, scalable, and secure solution.
Process
Discovery and Research
Conducted in-depth stakeholder interviews with diverse users: field workers, data analysts, and administrators.
Mapped out existing workflows and performed a heuristic evaluation of the current tools.
Identified critical pain points, including data fragmentation, time-intensive processes, and security gaps.
Define
Synthesized research insights into user personas and journey maps to illustrate the experience of users across different roles.
Identified key challenges: lack of a centralized system, time inefficiencies in data processing, and inconsistent data quality.
Opportunities were pinpointed around centralization, process automation, and enhanced data security.
Ideate
Conducted brainstorming workshops with cross-functional teams to explore potential solutions.
Solutions were evaluated for feasibility and impact, such as adopting a real-time monitoring system and integrating data collection tools.
Design
Developed wireframes for a new, centralized interface that supported real-time monitoring and improved device management.
Created user flows that simplified form creation, data cleaning, and analysis processes, making them more efficient and secure.
Designed features that ensured PII security, including data encryption and restricted access controls.
Test
Conducted usability testing with field teams, data entry specialists, and admins.
Gathered feedback, which was used to iterate on the prototype, refining the data validation and cleaning workflows.
Implementation
Partnered with service providers to integrate SurveyCTO as the primary data collection platform.
Implemented centralized device management and real-time data monitoring, improving both usability and security.
Key Insights
Fragmentation Leads to Inefficiency: Navigating between multiple systems was a key pain point for users, resulting in time wastage and data entry errors.
Centralization is Critical: A unified platform significantly improved efficiency, minimized errors, and reduced security risks.
Real-Time Monitoring: Lack of real-time data validation was causing downstream analysis issues.
Standardization: Inconsistent processes for data cleaning hindered scalability and quality.
Integrated Project Management: Communication and task management were improved with the integration of a project management tool.
Outcomes
185% Reduction in data processing time.
Fewer errors and improved data quality through real-time validation.
Improved Collaboration: Enhanced teamwork and communication with integrated project management tools.
Scalable: Systems designed to accommodate future organizational growth.
Enhanced Security: Implementation of advanced encryption and access control mechanisms.
Insightful Data Visualizations: More accessible data visualizations for decision-making.
Lessons Learned
User-Centered Design: Addressing user pain points led to significant efficiency improvements.
Standardization Improves Quality: Implementing standard processes enhanced both data quality and scalability.
Integration Matters: Centralizing the platform eliminated inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities.</p>
