# Intro
I led end-to-end research to understand adoption pathways for novel sanitation technology in emerging markets, working with a globally distributed team across Nigeria and Kenya to inform product strategy and market entry decisions.

The insights and recommendations helped guide the foundation's strategic investments while identifying key technical parameters for product iteration in two key markets.



# About the project
**I was hired as the Senior UX Research Lead for a significant initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to explore market opportunities for their Reinvented Toilets (RTs) â€” novel sanitation systems designed to address global sanitation challenges.** 

The project was led by Dalberg, a strategy and policy firm contracted by the Sanitation Technology Platform, an organization supporting the development and commercialization of BMGF's new sanitation products. I collaborated with a cross-functional team, including product designers, UX fellows, data collectors, and local guides, to conduct comprehensive field research across multiple cities.


# The Problem
Globally, 2.5 billion people lack access to improved sanitation. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in developing innovative toilet technology but needed to understand adoption pathways. **There was uncertainty about how to introduce this novel technology in low-income markets, making market-specific insights essential to inform both product design and go-to-market strategy.**

# Research goals
- Understand the pathways and opportunities for adopting RTs in Nigerian and Kenyan markets
- Identify user needs, preferences and barriers to adoption
- Evaluate technical parameters and infrastructure constraints
- Develop actionable recommendations for product iteration and market entry



# What I did
- **Team Alignment**: I led a diverse team across two countries, ensuring clear communication of project objectives and roles. I developed comprehensive research and recruitment plans while coordinating with local fixers and guides. I also reviewed and refined the quantitative survey to enable data triangulation, ensuring that qualitative and quantitative insights could be integrated for a robust analysis.
  
- **Research Methods**:
- **Contextual interviews**: Interviewing, observing and carefully documenting attitudes and behaviors with landlords, tenants and sellers
- **Card sorting**: Utilizing images, each with a particular sanitation feature, as discussion and prioritization tools. This exercise helped understand priorities and help uncover beliefs and biases.
- **Concept testing**: Engaging participants in a dialog around crafted prototypes to gauge preferences
- **Immersion and intercept interviews**: Leveraging immersion in a specific context to rapidly engage with individuals and groups for quick supplemental insights.



- **Research Scale**:
- 55 participants across Lagos, Nairobi and Mombasa
- 17 landlords
- 34 tenants
- 4 sellers

- **Data Synthesis & Reporting**: By triangulating qualitative and quantitative data, I uncovered key patterns in user needs, technical requirements and constraints, as well as market opportunities.
  
I developed **personas** for the target user groups in each market, **capturing the availability, accessibility, and reliability of basic services**. These personas **highlighted critical needs for essential services and preferences for potential by-products** produced by the Reinvented Toilets (RTs).

Using the insights gained from data analysis, I created detailed **summaries of input and output operating parameters of the RTs**. These parameters **outlined the ideal operating ranges for RT developers to consider when designing or modifying the systems**. 


# Key Insights
- **Affordability is Critical**: Households are price-sensitive and prioritize other basic needs (e.g. electricity) over sanitation improvements.
- **Product Value Lies in By-products**: RTs' ability to generate electricity or biogas was highly attractive.
- **Skepticism Toward New Products**: Users expressed skepticism toward unproven technologies and wanted physical proof before committing financially.
- **Infrastructure Constraints**: Limited access to basic utilities posed a challenge for RT operation.
  

# Organization Impact
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Delivered critical user, technical, and environmental requirements to partners, equipping them with the data needed to develop effective sanitation systems in targeted markets.

- **Market Opportunity Identification**: Determined that Nigeria presented a stronger market for Reinvented Toilets (RTs) compared to Kenya, due to higher demand for reliable basic services like electricity and water, and a less established sanitation market.

-**Strategic Investment Recommendations**: Provided the foundation with insights to guide $200 million in future grant investments, recommending projects such as multi-unit toilets and technologies that could produce electricity as a byproduct, aligning future development with market needs.
