# Intro
I led end-to-end research to understand adoption pathways for novel sanitation technology in emerging markets, working with a globally distributed team across Nigeria and Kenya to inform product strategy and market entry decisions.

The insights and recommendations helped guide the foundation's strategic investments while identifying key technical parameters for product iteration in two key markets.



# About the project
I was hired as the Senior Design Research Lead for **an initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to explore market opportunities for their Reinvented Toilets (RTs) — novel sanitation systems designed to address global sanitation challenges.** 

The project was led by Dalberg, a strategy and policy firm contracted by the Sanitation Technology Platform, an organization supporting the development and commercialization of BMGF's new sanitation products. **I collaborated with a cross-functional team, including product designers, UX fellows, data collectors, and local guides, to conduct comprehensive field research across multiple cities.**


# The Problem
Globally, 2 billion people lack access to basic sanitation [UNSTAT](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/goal-06/#:~:text=The%20population%20using%20safely%20managed,million%20people%20practised%20open%20defecation). The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in developing innovative toilet technology but needed to understand adoption pathways. **There was uncertainty about how to introduce this novel technology in low-income markets, making market-specific insights essential to inform both product design and go-to-market strategy.**

# Research goals
- Identify pathways and opportunities for adopting RTs in the Nigerian and Kenyan markets.
- Understand common sanitation needs, preferences, and behaviors across targeted user segments.
- Pinpoint specific design characteristics of RTs that best address customer needs and behavioral patterns.
- Generate insights to inform technical design and refine key product features of RTs.



# What I did
**Team Alignment**: I led two diverse field teams (10 members in total) across two countries, ensuring alignment and clear communication on project objectives and roles. I developed and implemented detailed research and recruitment plans, coordinating with local fixers and guides to facilitate seamless fieldwork.

Upwards alignment was essential due to the multiple stakeholders involved. Dalberg contracted with the **Sanitation Technology Platform (STeP)** to streamline field testing and commercialization of new sanitation products for the **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)**. Within Dalberg:

- **Dalberg Advisors** led the market-sizing and go-to-market strategy.
- **Dalberg Research** focused on quantitative research with target user groups.
- **Dalberg Design**, my department, conducted qualitative research with the same user groups.

To keep the project on track, I coordinated closely across Dalberg departments to ensure aligned objectives, improved execution, and integrated data collection efforts. I had weekly check-ins with **STeP** to share progress, discuss challenges, and adjust plans as needed. I also reported milestones to **BMGF**, presenting key deliverables and final insights to support data-driven decisions on product design and market strategy.
  
# Research Methods
**Multi-Method Approach**: I designed a sequential, multi-method research approach to minimize bias due to the cultural sensitivity around sanitation. Beginning with contextual interviews allowed us to build trust with participants without disclosing our primary focus on sanitation, enabling us to gain genuine insights into their daily lives and needs. By layering methods—contextual inquiry, card sorting, concept testing, and surveys—we could cross-verify responses and explore discrepancies more deeply. This approach was essential in capturing nuanced, culturally embedded sanitation needs, ensuring the Reinvented Toilet (RT) design truly aligned with user expectations and priorities.

- **Contextual interviews**: Conducted 55 interviews across 2 hours each with landlords, tenants, and sanitation device sellers. This approach allowed us to observe and document participant behaviors and attitudes in their living environments, focusing on utilities such as water, electricity, and sanitation. Through these interviews, we mapped participants' utility needs, income sources, and spending patterns, uncovering key decision points related to sanitation. This process also enabled us to identify technical parameters (e.g., water for flushing, electricity requirements) essential for the functioning of Reinvented Toilets (RTs) in real-world conditions.
- **Card sorting**: Used to understand participants' current priorities for upgrading sanitation systems. Each card depicted a feature under consideration, and participants ranked them based on preference, explaining their choices. This activity helped reveal underlying values and unmet needs while giving insight into immediate upgrade priorities. Visual cards helped overcome language barriers, allowing us to observe non-verbal cues, which facilitated further probing into preferences and biases.
- **Concept testing**:Since we didn't have a physical prototype due to development confidentiality, we created simple visual representations of the product's key features. We presented participants with a simplified image of the Reinvented Toilet (RT) and engaged them in an in-depth discussion about the potential by-products (e.g., treated water, compost) that the toilet could produce. Using visual images, participants selected their top three preferred by-products, explaining their rationale. We then explored practical aspects of the RT, including preferred installation locations, single vs. shared toilet preferences, device maintenance expectations, and willingness to pay. This allowed us to assess not only feature preferences but also their alignment with the sanitation needs in these communities.
- **Immersion and intercept interviews**: Conducted in local markets selling sanitation equipment, this method involved observing installation professionals and interviewing four vendors. By immersing ourselves in these markets, we identified critical branding and marketing considerations for RTs and gained insights into the full workflow of sanitation equipment, from purchase to installation.
- **Quantitative Surveys**: The team initially conducted a portion of the 600 planned surveys in one country. After I joined, I reviewed and refined the survey for better alignment and triangulation with our qualitative data collection methods. With these adjustments, the team completed the remaining surveys, enabling us to integrate quantitative and qualitative insights for a comprehensive analysis.


# Data Synthesis & Reporting

By triangulating qualitative and quantitative data, I uncovered key patterns in user needs, technical requirements and constraints, as well as market opportunities.
  
I developed **personas** for the target user groups in each market, **capturing the availability, accessibility, and reliability of basic services**. These personas **highlighted critical needs for essential services and preferences for potential by-products** produced by the Reinvented Toilets (RTs).

Using the insights gained from data analysis, I created detailed **summaries of the 12 input and 11 output operating parameters of the RTs**. These parameters **outlined the ideal operating ranges for RT developers to consider when designing or modifying the systems**. 


# Key Insights
- **Affordability is Critical**: Households are price-sensitive and prioritize other basic needs (e.g. electricity) over sanitation improvements.
  
- **Product Value Lies in By-products**: RTs' ability to generate electricity or biogas was highly attractive.
  
- **Skepticism Toward New Products**: Users expressed skepticism toward unproven technologies and wanted physical proof before committing financially.
  
- **Infrastructure Constraints**: Limited access to basic utilities posed a challenge for RT operation.
  

# Organization Impact
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Delivered critical user, technical, and environmental requirements to partners, **equipping stakeholders with the data needed to develop effective sanitation systems in targeted markets**.
