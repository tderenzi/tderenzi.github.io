# Intro
I **led the redesign of a fragmented data management system and user interface for population-based child assessment tools, streamlining operations and enhancing usability**. These improvements enabled the tools to be effectively used in South Africa's largest national survey of children's learning outcomes. My insights and strategic recommendations **achieved a 185% reduction in data processing time for the assessment tools, facilitating data-driven decision-making**. 


# About the project
The **Early Learning Outcome Measurement (ELOM)** team developed **population-based child assessment tools to evaluate whether children are developmentally on track for their age**. These tools effectively measure a range of developmental outcomes in young children and provide critical insights into the quality of early learning environments in both home and program settings.

**Innovation Edge**, an impact-driven investor focused on early childhood challenges, partnered with ELOM to fund and support the development and implementation of these tools. Beyond their investment, Innovation Edge played a critical role in integrating ELOM’s assessments into the Thrive by Five Index—a multi-sectoral initiative led by the Department of Basic Education. This national survey leverages ELOM’s tools to deliver critical insights into early learning outcomes, directly informing evidence-based policy and long-term program design. 

**I collaborated with ELOM to implement a centralized, scalable data strategy, optimizing their data management system and user interface to enhance data accuracy and user experience.** These improvements were critical to the successful execution of the Thrive by Five survey and its role in shaping long-term national strategies for early childhood development.

# The Problem
ELOM’s data management system was fragmented, with multiple servers and disconnected tools creating inefficiencies in form creation, data entry, and storage. This lack of centralization led to:

- **Delayed Processes**: Fragmented workflows hindered real-time monitoring and slowed data cleaning.
- **Data Security Risks**: Disjointed systems raised concerns about breaches and data loss.
- **Limited Scalability**: The inefficiencies constrained productivity and scalability, complicating efforts to support initiatives like the Thrive by Five survey.
  
These challenges jeopardized ELOM’s ability to deliver reliable, high-quality data, impacting their mission to improve early childhood outcomes and inform evidence-based policy.

# Research and Strategic goals
To address the challenges of a fragmented data management system and support ELOM’s mission to evaluate developmental outcomes and influence policy, the following goals were established:

**1. Diagnose the Current System**
- **Evaluate the Data Lifecycle**: Analyze the entire data value chain—from collection to analysis—to identify inefficiencies, refine processes, and pinpoint opportunities for improvement.
- **Identify User Pain Points**: Gather insights from key stakeholders, including funders, field assessors, data analysts, project managers, ECD experts, and decision-makers in early learning programs and initiatives. This research aimed to uncover frustrations, gaps, and unmet needs in the existing system.

**2. Enhance System and Governance**
- **System and Governance Improvements**: Design targeted improvements in data and project management processes while establishing a data governance framework aligned with South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA).
- **Develop Onboarding and Decision Processes**: Create a centralized repository for assessment requests to streamline decision-making and ensure projects align with ELOM’s strategic priorities.

**3. Implement and Validate Solutions**
- **Iterative Testing with Stakeholders**: Design and test solutions collaboratively with stakeholders to ensure updates meet user needs and compliance standards.
- **Develop a Scalable System**: Build an integrated system capable of handling multiple concurrent assessments while enhancing the capabilities of ELOM’s tools.
  
**4. Drive Long-Term Impact**
- **Enable Impact Tracking and Policy Influence**: Develop scalable systems and teams to measure developmental outcomes, supporting Innovation Edge, the Department of Basic Education, early learning programs, and related initiatives. These systems ensured that investments and programs could track their impact effectively and shape education policy and program design through robust, data-driven insights.


# What I did
I led a multi-disciplinary effort to redesign the data management system, UI, and onboarding processes for ELOM’s assessment tools. My approach was methodically chosen to align with the project’s goals of scalability, efficiency, and data quality, and was informed by a deep understanding of the needs and constraints of our diverse stakeholders.

**1. Discovery & Research**
- I conducted stakeholder interviews, workflow analyses, and tool evaluations to identify key pain points in the data lifecycle. **This research uncovered critical challenges for different user groups, including field assessors, data analysts, and decision-makers, ensuring that our solutions were grounded in real-world needs rather than assumptions.**

**2. Define & Align**
- I **synthesized research insights into personas, journey maps, and service blueprints to visualize user interactions and pinpoint high-impact areas for improvement**, such as data centralization, quality, and security. These artifacts helped align stakeholders around system improvements and provided a clear roadmap for the redesign.

**3. Ideation & Stakeholder Collaboration**
- Through cross-functional brainstorming workshops, I facilitated the generation of practical solutions and fostered alignment on key ideas, such as real-time monitoring, integrated tools, and centralized data systems. **This collaborative process encouraged stakeholder buy-in and ensured the feasibility and scalability of proposed solutions.**

**4. Design, Test, & Iterate**
- I led iterative design processes, conducting both moderated and unmoderated usability testing sessions to refine the UI, improve data entry accuracy, and enhance ease of use. **Feedback from these sessions was instrumental in adapting the system for diverse environments and workflows.**

**5. Onboarding & Decision Processes**
- I developed a centralized repository for assessment requests and introduced a weighted decision matrix to prioritize projects based on strategic goals. **This structured onboarding process enabled ELOM and Innovation Edge to allocate resources effectively, align projects with organizational priorities, and better track investment impact.**

**6. Scalable Training Solution**
- To address the challenge of workforce scalability, I partnered with a service provider to transition field assessor retraining from in-person sessions to an online e-learning platform. **This scalable approach ensured that the workforce stayed current with the latest assessment requirements, supporting consistent, high-quality assessments across regions.**

**7. Implementation & Integration**
- In collaboration with a service provider, I integrated SurveyCTO to centralize data collection and added features like device management, real-time monitoring, and enhanced security measures. **These enhancements ensured compliance with POPIA and supported scalability for high data volumes across varied field conditions.**

# Insights & Recommendations
**1. Fragmentation Causes Inefficiency and Security Risks**
- Seven servers and four disconnected tools created inefficiencies, delaying data cleaning, analysis, and decision-making.
- Fragmentation led to manual data transfers, errors, and inconsistent records, with PII transferred insecurely, risking data breaches.

**2. Centralization is Essential for Efficiency and Security**
- A centralized system for device management, form creation, and data storage would streamline workflows, reduce errors, and ensure compliance with data privacy.
- Centralization would enable real-time monitoring and faster data analysis, addressing delays caused by fragmented systems.

**3. Data Entry Errors Cause Downstream Delays**
- Errors during data collection propagated into analysis, leading to delays and inaccuracies.
- Real-time monitoring could flag issues at the point of entry, ensuring cleaner, higher-quality data.

**4. User Empowerment Improves Engagement**
- Allowing multiple users to create forms distributed workloads and increased engagement, improving data accuracy and accountability.

**5. Standardization Enables Scalability**
- Inconsistent processes for data cleaning and assessment administration led to errors and skewed results.
