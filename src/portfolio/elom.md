# Intro
As Head of Data Strategy, I **led the redesign of a fragmented data management system and its UI for ELOM’s population-based child assessment tools.** My responsibility extended to developing scalable systems and building teams that could measure outcomes, supporting South Africa's largest national survey of children's learning outcomes. **My insights and strategic recommendations led to a 185% reduction in data processing time, enhancing the quality of early learning programs and influencing policy through data-driven impact tracking.**


# About the project
**Innovation Edge, an impact-driven investor** in early childhood challenges in South Africa, invested and **partnered with ELOM to assess child development milestones and track the impact of their investments in education, health, and well-being.** ELOM’s assessments feed directly into the Thrive by Five index, a multi-sectoral effort led by the Department of Basic Education. This survey provides critical insights into early learning outcomes, shaping long-term national policy and program design. **I worked closely with ELOM to implement a centralized, scalable data strategy, optimizing both their data management system and UI for improved user experience and data accuracy**.


# The Problem
ELOM’s **data management system** faced challenges due to **fragmentation**, with multiple servers and disconnected tools creating an unmanageable process for form creation, data entry, and storage. **The lack of centralization prevented real-time monitoring, complicated data cleaning, and raised data security concerns, leading to delays and inaccuracies. These inefficiencies impacted productivity, decision-making, and scalability.** 

# Research goals
- Assess the entire data value chain of the system
- Identify critical pain points across user journeys
- Design an integrated, scalable, and secure solution
- Improve organizational efficiency and data quality


# What I did
- **Discovery and Research**: conducted comprehensive stakeholder interviews and workflow analysis while evaluating existing tools to identify critical pain points in the current system.
  
- **Define**: Synthesized research insights into user personas, journey maps, and service blueprints while identifying key challenges around data centralization, quality, and security enhancement opportunities.
  
- **Ideate**: Led cross-functional brainstorming workshops to evaluate potential solutions, focusing on real-time monitoring systems and data collection tool integration.
  
- **Design & Test**: Developed and tested a centralized interface design through wireframes and user flows, iterating based on field team usability testing feedback.
  
- **Implementation**: Partnered with service providers to successfully integrate a data collection platform (SurveyCTO), while implementing centralized device management, real-time monitoring, and enhanced security controls.

# Key Insights
- **Fragmentation Leads to Inefficiency**: Navigating between multiple systems was a key pain point for users, resulting in significant time wastage and data entry errors.
  
- **Centralization is Critical**: A unified platform significantly improved efficiency, minimized errors, and reduced security risks.
  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Lack of real-time data validation was causing downstream analysis issues.
  
- **Standardization**: Inconsistent processes for data cleaning hindered scalability and quality.
  
- **Integrated Project Management**: Communication and task management were improved with the integration of a project management tool and processes

# Impact
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduced data processing time by 185%, improved data quality, accelerated tool development, and strengthened teamwork.
   
- **Security Enhancement**: Implemented encryption, access controls, and improved data visualization accessibility.
   
- **Scale Achievement**: The redesign data management system was utilized in South Africa's largest national survey, reaching 5,000+ participants ( representing ~600,000 children), resulting in improving early learning programs and influencing policy.

- **Accelerated Tool Development**: Enabled rapid development of additional early childhood assessment tool development through real-time data monitoring, centralized database access, and faster analysis, iteration, and deployment.
