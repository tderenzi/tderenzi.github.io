# Intro
I led the user research to redesign a fragmented data management system for population-based child assessment tools. The insights and recommendations resulted in a **185% reduction in data processing time and supported South Africa's largest national survey of children's learning outcomes.**


# About the project
ELOM developed population-based child assessment tools to determine whether children are developmentally on track for their age. These tools evaluate early childhood programs' effectiveness, help organizations improve early learning interventions and guide policy decisions. **I was responsible for transforming their data management system to enable scale and improve efficiency**.


# The Problem
ELOMâ€™s **data management system** faced significant challenges due to **fragmentation**, with multiple servers and disconnected tools creating an unmanageable process for form creation, data entry, and storage. **The lack of centralization prevented real-time monitoring, complicated data cleaning, and raised data security concerns, leading to delays and inaccuracies. These inefficiencies impacted productivity, decision-making, and scalability.** 

# Research goals
- Assess the entire data value chain of the system
- Identify critical pain points across user journeys
- Design an integrated, scalable, and secure solution
- Improve organizational efficiency and data quality


# What I did
- **Discovery and Research**: conducted comprehensive stakeholder interviews and workflow analysis while evaluating existing tools to identify critical pain points in the current system.
  
- **Define**: Synthesized research insights into user personas, journey maps, and service blueprints while identifying key challenges around data centralization, quality, and security enhancement opportunities.
  
- **Ideate**: Led cross-functional brainstorming workshops to evaluate potential solutions, focusing on real-time monitoring systems and data collection tool integration.
  
- **Design & Test**: Developed and tested a centralized interface design through wireframes and user flows, iterating based on field team usability testing feedback.
  
- **Implementation**: Partnered with service providers to successfully integrate a data collection platform (SurveyCTO), while implementing centralized device management, real-time monitoring, and enhanced security controls.

# Key Insights
- **Fragmentation Leads to Inefficiency**: Navigating between multiple systems was a key pain point for users, resulting in significant time wastage and data entry errors.
  
- **Centralization is Critical**: A unified platform significantly improved efficiency, minimized errors, and reduced security risks.
  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Lack of real-time data validation was causing downstream analysis issues.
  
- **Standardization**: Inconsistent processes for data cleaning hindered scalability and quality.
  
- **Integrated Project Management**: Communication and task management were improved with the integration of a project management tool and processes

# Impact
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduced data processing time by 185%, improved data quality, accelerated tool development, and strengthened teamwork.
   
- **Security Enhancement**: Implemented encryption, access controls, and improved data visualization accessibility.
   
- **Scale Achievement**: The redesign data management system was utilized in South Africa's largest national survey, reaching 5,000+ participants ( representing ~600,000 children), resulting in improving early learning programs and influencing policy.

- **Accelerated Tool Development**: Enabled rapid development of additional early childhood assessment tool development through real-time data monitoring, centralized database access, and faster analysis, iteration, and deployment.
