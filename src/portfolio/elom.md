# Intro
I **led the redesign of a fragmented data management system and user interface for population-based child assessment tools, streamlining operations and enhancing usability**. These improvements enabled the tools to be effectively used in South Africa's largest national survey of children's learning outcomes. My insights and strategic recommendations **achieved a 185% reduction in data processing time for the assessment tools, facilitating data-driven decision-making**. 


# About the project
The **Early Learning Outcome Measurement (ELOM)** team developed **population-based child assessment tools to evaluate whether children are developmentally on track for their age**. These tools effectively measure a range of developmental outcomes in young children and provide critical insights into the quality of early learning environments in both home and program settings.

**Innovation Edge**, an impact-driven investor focused on early childhood challenges, partnered with ELOM to fund and support the development and implementation of these tools. Beyond their investment, Innovation Edge played a critical role in integrating ELOM’s assessments into the Thrive by Five Index—a multi-sectoral initiative led by the Department of Basic Education. This national survey leverages ELOM’s tools to deliver critical insights into early learning outcomes, directly informing evidence-based policy and long-term program design. 

**I collaborated with ELOM to implement a centralized, scalable data strategy, optimizing their data management system and user interface to enhance data accuracy and user experience.** These improvements were critical to the successful execution of the Thrive by Five survey and its role in shaping long-term national strategies for early childhood development.

# The Problem
ELOM’s data management system was fragmented, with multiple servers and disconnected tools creating inefficiencies in form creation, data entry, and storage. This lack of centralization led to:

- **Delayed Processes**: Fragmented workflows hindered real-time monitoring and slowed data cleaning.
- **Data Security Risks**: Disjointed systems raised concerns about breaches and data loss.
- **Limited Scalability**: The inefficiencies constrained productivity and scalability, complicating efforts to support initiatives like the Thrive by Five survey.
  
These challenges jeopardized ELOM’s ability to deliver reliable, high-quality data, impacting their mission to improve early childhood outcomes and inform evidence-based policy.

# Research and Strategic goals
- **Evaluate Data Lifecycle**: Assess the full data value chain—from collection to analysis—**to identify pain points, refine processes, and pinpoint potential improvements.**
  
- **Identify User Pain Points**: Gather insights from key users, including the funder, field assessors, data analysts, project managers, early childhood development (ECD) experts, and early learning program (ELC) decision-makers **to understand frustrations and gaps in the current system.**
  
- **System and Governance Improvements**: Design targeted improvements in data management, project management, and field assessor retraining, while establishing a data governance framework aligned with South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA).
  
- **Develop Onboarding and Decision Processes**: Create a centralized repository for all ELOM assessment requests to help the ELOM team effectively decide which projects to undertake. **This process aimed to align projects with ELOM's strategic goals and maximize organizational benefits.**
  
- **Iterative Testing with Stakeholders**: Test, analyze, and refine solutions with feedback from stakeholders, **ensuring that updates meet needs and compliance standards.**
  
- **Develop a Scalable System**: Build an integrated, flexible system capable of **handling multiple concurrent assessments and expanding assessment tool capabilities.**
  
- **Enable Impact Tracking and Policy Influence**: Create scalable systems and teams to measure outcomes, **helping Innovation Edge track investment impacts and influence educational policy through data-driven insights.**



# What I did
I led a multi-disciplinary effort to redesign the data management system, UI, and onboarding processes for ELOM’s assessment tools. My approach was methodically chosen to align with the project’s goals of scalability, efficiency, and data quality, and was informed by a deep understanding of the needs and constraints of our diverse stakeholders.

- **Discovery & Research**: I conducted stakeholder interviews, workflow analyses, and tool evaluations to identify key pain points. **This approach helped us understand each user group’s unique challenges, ensuring our solutions were tailored to real-world needs and avoiding assumptions that could hinder adoption.**
  
- **Define**: I synthesized insights into personas, journey maps, and service blueprints, allowing us to visualize user interactions and focus on high-impact areas like data centralization, quality, and security. **This step was critical for aligning system improvements with user needs.**
  
- **Ideate**: Facilitating cross-functional brainstorming workshops allowed team members to generate practical solutions and align around ideas like real-time monitoring and tool integration. **This collaborative approach fostered stakeholder buy-in and helped ensure that solutions were feasible and scalable.**
  
- **Design & Test**: I led iterative design and usability testing, using both moderated and unmoderated sessions to gather realistic feedback. **This method was essential to refine the UI, improve data entry accuracy, and ensure ease of use across diverse environments.**
  
- **Onboarding Process Development**: I created a centralized repository for assessment requests and a weighted decision matrix to prioritize projects based on strategic goals. **This structured approach allowed ELOM to make data-driven decisions, strategically allocate resources, and better track investment impact.**

- **E-Learning Platform for Field Training**: We partnered with a service provider to transition field assessor retraining from in-person sessions to an online e-learning platform, enabling simultaneous nationwide training. **This scalable approach ensured that the workforce stayed current with the latest assessment requirements, supporting consistent, high-quality assessments across regions.**
  
- **Implementation**: Partnering with service providers, we integrated SurveyCTO to centralize data collection and added device management, real-time monitoring, and security measures to ensure compliance with POPIA. **This solution was chosen for its scalability and ability to support high data volume and varied field conditions.**

# Impact
- **Efficiency and Security Enhancements**: Reduced ELOM’s data processing time by **185%**—from data collection to result communication—through a centralized database system that streamlined form design, enhanced quality control, and enabled real-time data monitoring and visualization. Additionally, implemented encryption and access controls to improve data security and visualization accessibility.

- **Improved Assessment Accuracy**: By implementing color-coded instructions, hard-coded stop rules, and instructional videos, we **increased the consistency and reliability of data collected by field assessors. These improvements minimized assessor variation, reduced data errors, and led to more accurate, actionable insights into child development outcomes.**

- **Cost-Effective Training**: The shift to an online e-learning platform **enabled simultaneous nationwide field assessment training, reducing costs, and eliminating the need for team travel**, making refresher training more accessible and sustainable.
   
- **Scale Achievement**: The redesign ELOM data management system & UI was utilized in South Africa's largest national survey, reaching 5,000+ participants ( representing ~600,000 children), resulting in improving early learning programs and influencing policy.

- **Informed Strategic Investments**: Enhanced data insights allowed Innovation Edge to optimize investments and make informed decisions in early learning programs, amplifying their impact across the sector.
