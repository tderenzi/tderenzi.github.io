        description: "We observed user behavior and interaction with three existing BMI and blood pressure kiosks in moderate to high volume of foot traffic areas. This audit helped us identify local usage patterns, kiosk placement issues, and potential adoption barriers in Kenya’s urban settings."

      - title: "Usability Testing"
        description: "Using Nielsen’s heuristics, we conducted a heuristic evaluation followed by in-lab usability tests. Six participants included both target (culturally Kenyan) and non-target populations, allowing us to capture usability differences due to cultural context. We noted critical issues in task completion, error rates, and user comfort during key interactions."

        description: "Due to research restrictions, participants were recruited from within IBM. To simulate realistic usage, we screened for culturally Kenyan and non-Kenyan users, providing a comparative understanding of how cultural background affected usability."

# Intro
I co-led user research to evaluate and optimize a late-stage prototype of a self-service health kiosk aimed at managing hypertension in resource-constrained environments, working closely with a multidisciplinary team to ensure the solution was both usable and culturally relevant.


# About the project
Hypertension is a growing health burden in sub-Saharan Africa, but access to healthcare resources is limited. IBM Research| Africa's healthcare team aimed to address this problem by developing the Cognitive Health Companion (CHC) - a self-service health kiosk that  interacted, collected, analysed, and continually delivered consumable health data to patients. 


# The Problem
The healthcare team’s initial research relied on literature and expert consultations but lacked direct engagement with target users in Kenya. Our role was to bridge this gap by evaluating and improving the CHC kiosk’s usability and cultural relevance for effective hypertension management. 

# Research goals
- Identify cultural barriers and accessibility challenges
- Evaluate usability of the CHC kiosk prototype
- Assess user comfort with self-service health technology
- Provide recommendations for interface optimization

# Research Methods


# Key Insights

**Cultural context**: The environmental audit revealed that **users in Kenya were accustomed to kiosks with attendants assisting them, leading to a significant knowledge gap when interacting with our self-service kiosk**. For example, none of the target population group interacted with the tablet without first asking the moderator and assumed they did not need to interact with the CHC device for the service to initiate:

> User-1 glanced around for a while and then stared at the tablet: "I need to read?"

> User-5 stepped onto the scale and looked around without touching the tablet. After **141 seconds**, User-5 then asked: "I should fill it in?"

> User-6 asked: "Do I have to touch the machine? Do I talk to the machine or touch the button?"

**Inferface Usability**: Target users experienced a **100% failure rate on registration and iris scanning** compared to a **66.7% failure** rate among non-target users. Task completion times for target users were on average **10.6% slower** than non-target users, particularly in the more complex registration and biometric tasks.

**User Satisfaction**: Despite **usability issues, target participants rated satisfaction high (average satisfaction score of 9.33/10)**, whereas non-target users rated it significantly lower (5/10). This discrepancy suggests a **strong social desirability bias among target users**, masking potential dissatisfaction and usability issues.

**Heuristic Evaluation Limitations**: Western-trained evaluators identified critical usability issues aligned with non-target population needs. However, many issues overlooked for target users, such as cultural familiarity and expectations for assistance, led to significant gaps. 


# Business Impact

- **Established Need for Foundational Research**: Demonstrated that early foundational research is essential to bridge the "Knowledge Gap" between users' existing knowledge and required task knowledge, improving intuitive interaction with complex kiosk systems.
  
- **Localized Heuristics for Cultural Relevance**: Emphasized the value of culturally tailored heuristics, helping align product design with local expectations and improving evaluation accuracy.

- **Reduced Participant Bias in Usability Testing**: Adapted usability testing protocols to mitigate participant bias, leading to more honest, actionable feedback from users, which informed product adjustments for improved user satisfaction and engagement.
  
- **Patent Achievement**: Insights led to the development of an innovation product testing methodology, which contributed to protected intellectual property for IBM.

- **Research Influence**: Co-authored a chapter with colleagues, contributing to the field with research insights and advancing industry knowledge on user experience in healthcare technology. This publication underscored the importance of cultural context and usability in designing impactful solutions for emerging markets.
