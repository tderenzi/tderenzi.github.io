# Intro
I led user research to evaluate and optimize a late-stage prototype of a self-service health kiosk aimed at managing hypertension in resource-constrained environments, working closely with a multidisciplinary team to ensure the solution was both usable and culturally relevant.


# About the project
Hypertension is a growing health burden in sub-Saharan Africa, but access to healthcare resources is limited. The Cognitive Health Companion (CHC) kiosk was designed to help address this gap. My task was to evaluate and optimize the user experience of the kiosk for the target population.


# The Problem
Hypertension is a significant public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the lack of health resources makes it challenging to serve those in need. CHC was designed to serve that population. Our challenge was to evaluate a self-service health kiosk that would provide an intuitive, culturally relevant user experience for patients managing hypertension in Kenya. 

# Research goals
- Evaluate usability of the CHC kiosk prototype
- Identify cultural barriers and accessibility challenges
- Assess user comfort with self-service health technology
- Provide recommendations for interface optimization



# What I did
- **Discovery and Research**: conducted comprehensive stakeholder interviews and workflow analysis while evaluating existing tools to identify critical pain points in the current system.
- **Define**: Synthesized research insights into user personas and journey maps while identifying key challenges around data centralization, quality, and security enhancement opportunities.
- **Ideate**: Led cross-functional brainstorming workshops to evaluate potential solutions, focusing on real-time monitoring systems and data collection tool integration.
- **Design & Test**: Developed and tested a centralized interface design through wireframes and user flows, iterating based on field team usability testing feedback.
- **Implementation**: Partnered with service providers to successfully integrate a data collection platform (SurveyCTO), while implementing centralized device management, real-time monitoring, and enhanced security controls.

# Key Insights
1. **Fragmentation Leads to Inefficiency**: Navigating between multiple systems was a key pain point for users, resulting in significant time wastage and data entry errors.
2. **Centralization is Critical**: A unified platform significantly improved efficiency, minimized errors, and reduced security risks.
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Lack of real-time data validation was causing downstream analysis issues.
4. **Standardization**: Inconsistent processes for data cleaning hindered scalability and quality.
5. **Integrated Project Management**: Communication and task management were improved with the integration of a project management tool and processes

# Organization Impact
1. **Efficiency Gains**: Reduced data processing time by 185%, improved data quality, accelerated tool development, and strengthened teamwork.
